Presentation
============

This is  the top  level directory  of all  resource files  provided by
Falaise.

Contents:

 * ``README.rst`` : this file
 * ``config`` : the top directory for all official configuration files
   used   by  the   simulation,  reconstruction   and  data   analysis
   processing.   Our  convention  is  to   organize  the  files  in  a
   meaningfull  hierarchy, that  enables configuration  versioning and
   reusability  of  versioned  resource  files.

   All  files  should  be  accessible from  within  Bayeux  file  path
   utilities    (``datatools::fetch_path_with_env``...)    with    the
   following syntax: ::

     "@falaise:config/topic/subtopic/.../version/filename"

   Example  for   the  main  configuration  file   for  the  SuperNEMO
   demonstrator module virtual geometry: ::

     "@falaise:config/geometry/snemo/demonstrator/3.0/manager.conf"

 * ``modules``  :  the  top  directory  for  all  configuration  files
   associated  to plugin  modules.  A  module with  name ``Foo``  must
   stores  its  resource files  in  the  ``modules/Foo/``.

   Example for a typical configuration  file for the ``Foo`` module is
   then addressed with the following syntax: ::

     "@falaise:modules/Foo/config/snemo/reconstruction/1.0/foo.conf"
